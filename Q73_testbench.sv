//Q73. What is bind construct used in SystemVerilog for?

The bind construct in SystemVerilog is a powerful feature used to associate additional functionality, such as assertions, coverage, or auxiliary modules, with an existing module or instance without modifying its original source code. 
This is particularly useful in verification environments where you want to add checks or monitors to a design without altering the design itself.
  
Key Uses of the bind Construct-
  
Adding Assertions: You can use bind to attach assertions to a module or instance to verify its behavior. This allows you to check properties and conditions without modifying the design code.
  
Adding Coverage: Coverage points can be bound to a module to track specific events or conditions during simulation, helping to ensure thorough verification.
  
Attaching Auxiliary Modules: You can bind auxiliary modules, such as monitors or scoreboards to a design module to observe and record its behavior during simulation.
  
Non-Intrusive Verification:
The bind construct allows you to add verification logic in a non-intrusive manner, meaning the original design code remains unchanged. 
This is particularly useful when working with third-party IP or legacy code.
    
Syntax:The basic syntax of the bind construct involves specifying the target module or instance and the module that contains the additional functionality is as below:

bind target_module_or_instance bound_module bound_instance_name;
  
 Where,
  
  target_module_or_instance: The module or instance to which you want to bind additional functionality.
    
  bound_module: The module that contains the assertions, coverage, or other functionality you want to bind.
    
  bound_instance_name: The name of the instance created by the bind operation.
