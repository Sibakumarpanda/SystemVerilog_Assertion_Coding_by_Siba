//Q56. What are the advantages of writing a checker using SVA (SystemVerilog Assertions) as compared to writing it using a procedural SystemVerilog code?

Writing checkers using SystemVerilog Assertions (SVA) instead of procedural SystemVerilog code provides several advantages, particularly in terms of 
conciseness, clarity, reusability, and simulation performance.
Here's a breakdown of the key advantages:

1. Conciseness and Expressiveness:
SVA allows you to express complex temporal behaviors and sequence relationships in a declarative and compact way.

Procedural code (e.g., using always blocks and if statements) tends to be more verbose and harder to read or maintain for such patterns.

Example:
// SVA: Check if signal 'a' is followed by 'b' after 2 cycles
a |=> ##2 b;
                 
                 
// Procedural code
always @(posedge clk) begin
  if (a) begin
    @(posedge clk); // wait 1 cycle
    @(posedge clk); // wait 2nd cycle
    if (!b) 
      $error("b did not occur 2 cycles after a");
  end
end
                 
2. Temporal Abstraction:
                 
SVA is specifically designed to handle temporal properties and event relationships over time (e.g., ordering, delays, repetitions).
Procedural code requires manual state tracking, which increases complexity and risk of bugs.  
                 
                 
3. Simulation Performance:
                 
SVA checkers are optimized by simulators, often with faster execution than equivalent procedural logic.
This optimization becomes more significant when checking many conditions or in large designs.

4. Formal Verification Compatibility:
                 
SVA is directly supported by formal verification tools, enabling automatic property checking and exhaustive analysis.
Procedural code typically cannot be used in formal verification tools for assertions or properties.
  
  
5. Reusability and Modularity:
  
Assertions can be packaged into modules, interfaces, or bindfiles, making them reusable across designs.
Procedural code is often tied to a specific context, making reuse harder.

6. Reduced Debug Effort:
Assertion failures are reported with precise timing and cause, often pointing directly to the violated property.
Procedural code may only provide a general error or require additional debug logic.
  
  
7. Declarative Intent:
SVA clearly communicates what behavior is expected, not how to monitor it, which improves readability and intent clarity.
